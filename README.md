The "Screen Saver WebExtensions" offers three different animations, inspired of the universe demoscene and one of them, you will be able to customize it from the settings screen. 


## Goal

The purpose of the extension is to display an animated screen at any time, from your Firefox browser without having to lock your session.

For this, a single button, represented by an icon, ![Screenshot](screenshots/icon.png "icône pour lancer l'animation") to launch the animation. It is positioned in the toolbar.

To choose a another animation, you will go through the settings screen.


## The settings screen

## Feature : Fullscreen

When you check the 'fullscreen' box, the animation does not automatically switch to full screen mode. To see the animation in full screen, you tap a key on your keyboard.

However, it is possible to fully enjoy the full screen, when the 'fullscreen' box is not checked by pressing the {F11} key on your keyboard followed by the {F5} key.

The automatic execution of the 'fullscreen' effect is not supported with the Fullscreen API and in the WebExtensions permissions.
